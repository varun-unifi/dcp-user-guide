	                    <p>Enterprises need the ability to co-mingle datasets from various data sources, including cloud, on-premise, and social. DCP provides rich connectivity to heterogeneous data sources including databases, Hadoop file systems, Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), Salesforce and Marketo services, and more. Both structured and semi-structured data can be integrated for use in analysis scenarios.</p>
	                    <p>To integrate the data more quickly, DCP automatically applies complex data parsers and data logic to semi-structured and unstructured data. In social media data, for example, some structure exists, but much of the data must be parsed and normalized before any analysis can occur.</p>
	                    <p>After passing through the DCP data parser, the data is presented to the business analyst user in the familiar format of rows and columns. Without DCP, software developers would be required to hand code the integration with very technology-oriented tools.</p>

	                    <p>A datastore describes a specific instance of a system external to DCP that holds data. For example, a datastore may represent an Oracle database, an Amazon S3 or Hadoop file system, a Salesforce account, or any other data storage system supported by DCP.</p>
	                    <p>Datastores are available in the DCP user interface only after they have been added to DCP, usually by a DCP administrator. When the administrator adds a datastore, they are adding information about how to connect to an external system.</p>
	                    <p>The datastores are external to DCP, so DCP needs a way to communicate with them. DCP provides a variety of datastore adapters for this purpose. A datastore is typically specified by a DCP datastore adapter and the parameters associated with that adapter. The parameters might include the host name, host IP address, port, and similar characteristics. For more information see "Adapters" and "Data Stores" in the DCP Administrator’s Guide.</p>

	                    <p>When a dataset is added, the data is parsed by DCP:</p>
	                    <ul>
	                        <li>DCP detects the structure of the data and creates a list of columns. DCP can detect the characters that separate the data values in a comma-separated value (CSV) file, the name-value pairs in a JSON file, and more. DCP can also work with semi-structured data, where there is no obvious column separator and the data can come from various non-tabular sources such as log files. If the data is in a database, DCP’s job is made easy, because the database has already defined the columns.</li>
	                        <li>The data type of each data value is detected, such as String (STR), Integer (INT), or Date (DAT). Some of the data is categorized under the classification Personally Identifiable Information (PII), including credit card numbers, social security numbers, email addresses, phone numbers and IP addresses. DCP also supports Character Large Object (CLOB) data. Users can override the automatically assigned data type later. DCP also detects Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and masks it based on default rules.</li>
	                        <li>After the data is detected, the system imports a technical data dictionary  and merges it with a business data dictionary  and displays both on the Dataset Explorer Data Dictionary  page. The technical data dictionary  includes data types from the database, column comment, and database comments.</li>
	                        <li>Missing column values and badly written rows are identified.</li>
	                        <li>
	                            System Hive, MS SQL server, and Adobe Cloud datasets can be marked as "Writable", allowing them to be used as output targets. Where one of these dataset types is the output target in Jobs and Schedules, only writeable datasets can be chosen.

	                    <p>A join is a logical connection between two sets of data, based on matching values in certain fields. New data rows are created that contain values from both datasets.</p>
	                    <p>For example, if you have a database table that contains customer addresses and another database table that contains customer orders, the two tables can be joined on the customer name. In this way, the address information is associated with each order.</p>
	                    <p>In DCP, joins are used when creating transform jobs. The DCP user interface provides graphical guidance and suggestions to make creating joins easier. You will typically just need to click "Save" to accept the default join suggestions provided. However, to get the most out of your transform jobs, it can be useful to learn more about joins. For example, joins come in various types, such as inner joins and outer joins. The join type affects how the join operates.</p>
	                    <p>Joins are a major topic in the field of data storage. If you are not familiar with joins, you can learn more from the large amounts of information available in print and online.</p>

Each custom UDF extends the Hive UDF class and implements the evaluate method. Inside this evaluate method, write the code to perform whatever function you need on the data. Compile the code, upload it to your Hive cluster, and run a few Hive console commands to make the UDF available for use. The UDF can then be used in derived attribute definitions just like any other Hive function. For more information about creating custom UDFs, see:</p>

For example, you might use the results from one transform job as input to a second transform job. In this type of scenario, you can set DCP up to run the second job in the workflow only if the first job completes successfully.</p>
	                    <p>A workflow can also contain just a single job. In fact, every job is required to be in a workflow in order to run. When a user runs an individual job directly, DCP creates a default workflow for the job.</p>

	                    <p>When creating a schedule, you can configure it to use incremental data capture (IDC) for one or more of the jobs in the workflow. When IDC is used, the job retrieves only data that has been added since the last time the workflow ran.</p>
	                    <p>IDC is useful to operationalize a workflow by scheduling it to run at given time intervals and consider only new data for each run.</p>
	                    <p>To set up IDC, you designate a particular database column as the IDC column for that job. For example, consider a transaction store database where every new transaction is logged with a transaction timestamp, item purchased, quantity, sale price, and other details. A job that aggregates total daily transactions could schedule the workflow to run once each day and use the timestamp column as the IDC column.</p>
	                    <p>Typically, date or timestamp columns are used for IDC. Alternatively, use any column where new values are always added in increasing order; for example, auto-generated row numbers.</p>
